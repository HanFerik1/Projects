This Java program solves the problem of determining the minimum number of swaps needed to arrange books on a shelf, following a specific order: large books ('L'), medium-sized books ('M'), and small books ('S'). The program first counts the occurrences of each type of book ('L', 'M', 'S') by iterating through the input string. Based on these counts, it divides the input string into three regions: the first region contains only 'L' books, the second contains 'M' books, and the third contains 'S' books.

The program then checks how many misplaced books there are in each region. For example, in the 'L' region, it counts how many 'M' and 'S' books are present. Similarly, it does this for the 'M' and 'S' regions. By tracking how many books are misplaced, it calculates how many swaps are required to move the misplaced books to their correct regions.

To calculate the minimum number of swaps, the program uses the Math.max() function to determine the maximum number of misplacements for each pair of regions (i.e., 'L' in 'M' and 'M' in 'L', 'M' in 'S' and 'S' in 'M', and 'L' in 'S' and 'S' in 'L'). The sum of these values gives the minimum number of swaps needed to arrange the books as per the desired order. Finally, the result is printed, which represents the fewest swaps required to achieve the desired arrangement of books.
